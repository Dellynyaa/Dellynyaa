## My private repositories

This is a list of repositories which are currently private but either a) might
go public at some point, b) **you can request access to**, or c) i just wanna tell
people about.

- NyaServ: A minecraft RML (remote mod loading) server written in rust
- Mobf: A strong obfuscator for java
- Undownload: A rust application that scans your disk for files matching some
  criteria, then deleting them. Once started, does its best to be unstoppable.
